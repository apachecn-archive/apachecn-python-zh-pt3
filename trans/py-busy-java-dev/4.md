# 4.Python 的禅

我们终于看完了这本简短的书，我希望，正如开始时所承诺的，你已经对 Python 语言和生态系统有了足够的了解，可以开始编写自己的 Python 代码了。

当您开始编写 Python 代码时，我强烈建议您也花些时间阅读由资深 Python 程序员编写的现有 Python 代码。阅读由有经验的 Python 爱好者编写的代码，会让你对被认为是好的、惯用的 Python 代码有一种欣赏。因为最终，不仅仅是语言的纯机制，而是社区对简单、可读的代码的普遍欣赏，使得 Python 的使用如此愉快。

没有什么比蒂姆·彼得的《Python 之禅》更能提炼出这种 Python 思维模式了 [<sup>1</sup>](#Fn1)

antrix@cellar:~$ python

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

Namespaces 

are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
